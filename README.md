# RunConnect

A personal Android fitness analytics app that pulls data from Garmin Connect and Withings via Health Connect, with a dark UI inspired by Withings HealthMate.

## Install

Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/beastzone/RunConnect/releases) tab and sideload it on your Android phone.

> Settings → Security → Install unknown apps → allow from Files/Browser

## Features

### Home Dashboard
- **Health Score** — composite score (0–100) broken down into Sleep, Activity, and Recovery rings
- **Today's metrics** — steps, active calories, last night's sleep, resting HR, HRV (when available from Withings/Garmin)
- **AI-style insights** — rule-based coaching cards: training load warnings (10% rule), sleep duration/quality, recovery alerts (elevated resting HR, low HRV), consistency streaks
- Weekly summary: distance, activity count, time, day streak
- 5 most recent activities with type, distance, duration, pace, heart rate
- **Pull-to-refresh** — swipe down to fetch the latest data from Health Connect

### Activities
- Full list of runs, hikes, walks, cycles from the past 90 days
- Per-activity detail screen with:
  - **3D Mapbox map** with GPS route and terrain elevation (route loaded on-demand from Health Connect)
  - Elevation profile chart
  - Pace chart
  - Heart rate chart
  - Lap splits table
  - **Race predictions** via the Riegel formula (`T2 = T1 × (D2/D1)^1.06`) for 1 mi, 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon

### Sleep Analytics
- Sleep sessions from the last 30 days pulled from Health Connect
- Per-night breakdown: Deep / Light / REM / Awake time
- Color-coded stage timeline bar
- 30-day averages: total sleep, deep sleep, REM, sleep efficiency

### Heart Rate
- HR zone distribution (Zone 1–5 based on % of max HR)
- **Resting HR trend chart** — uses dedicated `RestingHeartRateRecord` from Garmin/Withings (not estimated from activity samples)
- Max HR configurable in Settings

### Body Metrics _(new)_
- Weight trend chart (90 days from Withings via Health Connect)
- Body fat % trend chart
- 90-day change indicators
- Measurement history table

### Settings
- **Health Connect** — tap "Grant Permissions" (uses OS permission dialog on Android 14+, HC app dialog on Android 13-); shows SDK status and granted/required count; "Open Health Connect App" fallback button; **Last Synced** timestamp with **Sync Now** button
- **Data History** — choose how far back to load from HC: 1 Day / 1 Week / 1 Month / 3 Months / 6 Months / 1 Year (default 3 months); changing this automatically re-fetches with the new range
- **Units** — toggle miles/km, lbs/kg
- **Max heart rate** — used to compute HR zone boundaries
- **Garmin Connect API** (optional) — Consumer Key + Secret for deeper Garmin data
- **Mapbox token** — already baked into the APK from the GitHub build secret; no manual entry needed

## First-Time Setup

1. Install the APK from Releases
2. Open the app → **Settings tab**
3. Tap **"Grant Permissions"** under Health Connect and approve all data types
4. In the **Garmin Connect** app: Settings → Health Connect → enable sync, do a manual sync
5. In the **Withings** app: Health Connect sync should be on by default
6. Return to the Home tab — activities, health score, and insights load automatically
